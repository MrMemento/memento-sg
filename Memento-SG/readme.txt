Shortcode Framework with advanced PHP parsing and JavaScript / CSS managing

skills within WP without having to know anything about what happens in the
background of WP


**Based on:**

**Ideas taken from WP plugins:**

* <a href="http://www.viper007bond.com/wordpress-plugins/syntaxhighlighter/">Viper007Bond's Syntax Highlighter</a>
* <a href="http://www.deanlee.cn/wordpress/google-code-prettify-for-wordpress/">Dean Lee's Google Code Prettify</a>
* <a href="http://rulesplayer.890m.com/blog/?page_id=4">bobef's WP-CodePress</a>

	* added language "php_snippet", to have php code
		highlighted without the opening and closing PHP tag
	* added TAB key support, so instead of changing focus, TAB key will insert
		tabulator
* <a href="http://thechriswalker.net/">Modified version of Chris Walker's Multiple Drag&Drop Lists</a>
